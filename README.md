    <h2>Creating a COVID-19 Dashboard with Tableau</h2>

    <p>A COVID-19 dashboard project using Tableau for India involves collecting relevant data and visualizing it in a meaningful way to provide insights into the pandemic's impact. Here are the key elements to consider:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Title and Introduction:</strong> Provide a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the dashboard. Include a brief introduction to explain what the dashboard displays.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> Display the most important metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and vaccination rates prominently at the top of the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Series Graphs:</strong> Use line charts or area charts to show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. Include separate charts for daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographical Visualization:</strong> Add a map to show the distribution of cases across different states or regions in India. Use color coding to represent the severity of cases.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaccination Progress:</strong> Include a visualization that shows the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Data:</strong> Display the number of tests conducted and the positivity rate in a clear manner.</li>
        <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> Compare COVID-19 data between different states or regions to identify trends and disparities.</li>
    </ol>
