## Creating a COVID-19 Dashboard with Tableau

A COVID-19 dashboard project using Tableau for India involves collecting relevant data and visualizing it in a meaningful way to provide insights into the pandemic's impact. Here are the key elements to consider:

   **Title and Introduction:** Provide a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the dashboard. Include a brief introduction to explain what the dashboard displays.
**Key Metrics:** Display the most important metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and vaccination rates prominently at the top of the dashboard.
   **Time Series Graphs:** Use line charts or area charts to show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. Include separate charts for daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.
**Geographical Visualization:** Add a map to show the distribution of cases across different states or regions in India. Use color coding to represent the severity of cases.
**Vaccination Progress:** Include a visualization that shows the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.
**Testing Data:** Display the number of tests conducted and the positivity rate in a clear manner.
**Comparative Analysis:** Compare COVID-19 data between different states or regions to identify trends and disparities.
