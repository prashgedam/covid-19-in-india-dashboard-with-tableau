Creating a COVID-19 dashboard project using Tableau for India involves collecting relevant data and visualizing it in a meaningful way to provide insights into the pandemic's impact. 
 Design the layout and appearance of your dashboard. Consider the following elements:

    Title and Introduction: Provide a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the dashboard. Include a brief introduction to explain what the dashboard displays.
    Key Metrics: Display the most important metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and vaccination rates prominently at the top of the dashboard.
    Time Series Graphs: Create line charts or area charts to show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. You can include separate charts for daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    Geographical Visualization: Add a map to show the distribution of cases across different states or regions in India. Use color coding to represent the severity of cases.
    Vaccination Progress: Include a visualization that shows the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.
    Testing Data: Display the number of tests conducted and the positivity rate in a clear manner.
    Comparative Analysis: Compare COVID-19 data between different states or regions to identify trends and disparities.
