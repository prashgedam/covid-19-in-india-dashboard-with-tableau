Creating a COVID-19 dashboard project using Tableau for India involves collecting relevant data and visualizing it in a meaningful way to provide insights into the pandemic's impact. 
 Design the layout and appearance of your dashboard. Consider the following elements:

    <strong>Title and Introduction:   </strong> Provide a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the dashboard. Include a brief introduction to explain what the dashboard displays. <br>
    <strong>Key Metrics: </strong>  Display the most important metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and vaccination rates prominently at the top of the dashboard.<br>
     <strong>Time Series Graphs: </strong> line charts or area charts to show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. You can include separate charts for daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.<br>
     <strong>Geographical Visualization: </strong> Add a map to show the distribution of cases across different states or regions in India. Use color coding to represent the severity of cases.<br>
      <strong>Vaccination Progress: </strong>Include a visualization that shows the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.<br>
      <strong>Testing Data: </strong> Display the number of tests conducted and the positivity rate in a clear manner.<br>
   <strong> Comparative Analysis: </strong> Compare COVID-19 data between different states or regions to identify trends and disparities.<br>
