Creating a COVID-19 dashboard project using Tableau for India involves collecting relevant data and visualizing it in a meaningful way to provide insights into the pandemic's impact. 
 Design the layout and appearance of your dashboard. Consider the following elements:

    <h3>Title and Introduction: </h3> Provide a title that clearly indicates the purpose of the dashboard. Include a brief introduction to explain what the dashboard displays. <br>
    <h3>Key Metrics:</h3>  Display the most important metrics like total cases, active cases, recovered cases, deaths, and vaccination rates prominently at the top of the dashboard.
    <h3>Time Series Graphs:</h3>  Create line charts or area charts to show the progression of COVID-19 cases over time. You can include separate charts for daily cases, deaths, and recoveries.
     <h3>Geographical Visualization:</h3>  Add a map to show the distribution of cases across different states or regions in India. Use color coding to represent the severity of cases.
    <h3>Vaccination Progress:</h3> Include a visualization that shows the progress of vaccination efforts, including the number of doses administered and the percentage of the population vaccinated.
    <h3>Testing Data:</h3>  Display the number of tests conducted and the positivity rate in a clear manner.
  <h3> Comparative Analysis:</h3>  Compare COVID-19 data between different states or regions to identify trends and disparities.
